"There's a new arrangement in place   I can set up an arrangement for £14.00 per month for the next 2 months. Your monthly interest will be lowered to 0.5% per month for the rest of your plan. 
This will not bring your account up-to-date but will give you some breathing space from your normal payments. We'll report to the main Credit Referencing Agencies to show that you are on an arrangement.",
